regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the
course of the subject?
- Estimating the time that I have spent for practical tasks, it was difficult at first, but with practice and
  experience, I was able to do more accurately and use less time to finish the work. So, I am willing to practice with
  different coding challenges in the future.

regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- Participating in code reviews during practicals has been quite beneficial. It introduced me to numerous Python writing
  styles, best practices, and debugging approaches. Giving and receiving comments on code has significantly boosted my
  coding skills.

regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
- If I were in charge of the subject, I would emphasize essential enhancements. To begin, I would make sure that each
  task is given clear objectives to assist students' understanding. And would implement a structured feedback that would
  help students to further their skills, supporting continual growth like as our lecturer has been doing all the way
  long. Lastly, I would ensure to provide a more well-rounded and engaging learning experience for students.
